You can access the app on any iOS device just now by going to http://littlesick.herokuapp.com/.

If you open this link in Safari, then click on the Share button (in the middle of the bottom toolbar) and select Add to Home Screen, it will add what looks like an app to your device that has the look and feel of an iPhone app.

First time you use the app it will prompt you to let the app use your current location. Please agree to this or the app won't work. :)

If you have any issues, please email [little-sick-app@googlegroups.com](mailto:little-sick-app@googlegroups.com).
